# Node Auth Boilerplate

this is a boiler plate for an Express app with local user authentication. It exists so I have a customized boilerplate and don't have to start from scratch on all my projects.

## What It Includes

* Local Auth (email and password)
* Passport and passport-local
* Sessions for saving user info and displaying flash message
* Settings for PostresSQL and sequelize
* Hashed passwords
* EJS templating and ejs layouts
* Sequelize user model
* Materialize styling - nav and footer
